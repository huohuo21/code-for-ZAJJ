//// these code are specially for data VS backgrounds while using
//// photon-like-jet samples, follow steps below:
////
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Step1: use codes in jet-fake-photon to get faterate with respect to photon pt bins

Step2: after you confirm your final cut in final plots, use these cuts for both data and photon-like-jet samples, and output an photon-pt distribution(here named "fout.root") for both data and p-l-j smaple(note that the photon-pt bin should consistent with Step1)

Step3: use fakerate, data bincontent and p-l-j bincontent to calculate a scale-factor for each photon-pt bin, therefore every event in p-l-j sample will get a weight according to this scale-factor

//////////////////////////////////////////
/// (Step2 and Step3 using code in for_scale)
//////////////////////////////////////////

Step4: declare the scale-factor of p-l-j events in the EDBRHistoMaker.h, and finally Fill histograms with the scale-factor according to the event's photon-pt

Step5: do QCD-ZAjj rescale. after previous steps, the mc is still not consistent with data. As Mjj is a powerful discriminator, and signal nearly have no contribution at the small Mjj control region(150~400 GeV), rescale QCD-ZAjj to let mc equal to data in control region.

Step6: calculate significance. choose a signal region Mjj>1 TeV(could be higher), and calculate significance, could simplely use cut count S/sqrt(B) or Higgs conbination tool.
